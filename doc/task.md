Arithmetic Quiz
===============
For the following scenario analyse the detailed requirements for each situation
and, using suitable algorithms, design a solution to be coded in a suitable
high-level programming language. Show the iterative development of the
individual solutions with suitable testing throughout the process. Test the
final products and evaluate your solutions against the detailed requirements
you identified in the analysis.

[Task 1](task-1.md)
------
A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic
skills of her students. The program should generate a quiz consisting of a
series of random questions, using in each case any two numbers and addition,
subtraction and multiplication. The system should ask the student's name, then
ask 10 questions, output if the answer to each question is correct or not and
produce a final score out of 10.

[Task 2](task-2.md)
------
The teacher wants to keep track of the scores each member of the class contains
in the quiz. There are three classes in the school and the data should be kept
separately for each class.

[Task 3](task-3.md)
------
The teacher wants to use the results from students taking these quizzes to log
their performance. The system should store the last three scores for each
student. The teacher would like to be able to output the results of the quiz
for a particular class, sorted:

- in alphabetical order with each student's highest score for the tests
- by the highest score, highest to lowest
- by the average score, highest to lowest.
