        Arithmetic Quiz - Writeup
        =========================

        Task 1
        ------
        > A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students.
        > The program should generate a quiz consisting of a series of random questions, using in each case any two
        > numbers and addition, subtraction and multiplication. The system should ask the student's name, then ask 10
        > questions, output if the answer to each question is correct or not and produce a final score out of 10.

        ### Success Criteria:
        - It must be able to generate a quiz containing 10 questions. In order to properly test the students in
          consecutive quizzes, the program should generate random questions instead of using a reset 10 questions every
          time.
        - The system must be able to ask the students name.
        - It must then show these questions to the student in a human-readable format so that the students can
          understand what the program is asking them to solve.
        - The student should be able to enter an answer to the question.
        - The program should store the answers given so that a score can be given at the end of the quiz.

        After I have written the code I will test that the program performs as expected against these success criteria.

        ### Design
        I have made a flow chart to show the high level structure of the program I will be writing.
        <img src="flowchart1.png" height="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" />

        Alternately, I could have made the program ask a question then ask an answer, but I believe this solution to be
        better suited to the medium which I have chosen to deliver this program on: the web.

        ### Implementation
        I have chosen to write this program as a web application instead of a commandline application for several
        reasons:

        - It is easier for the students to access the program.
        - It is possible for multiple students to use the program at the same time.
        - I want to challenge myself.

        Web pages are served in a language called HTML which describes the content of the page and how to display it.
        HTML however is not a programming language because while it does provide a way of collecting user input, it
        does not provide any way of using logic. Because of this limitation, I will have to write a program which
        generates HTML and receives the user input from HTML.

        I have chosen to write the program which generated the HTML in a programming language called ruby because I am
        familiar with the language from previous projects and it has many tools already available for helping generate
        and server webpages.

        In particular I will be using a web framework called "padrino" to help me write the web application. The padrino
        framework allows me to write in terms of models, views and controllers.

        - Models represent the core data format of an application, in our case 'quiz' and 'student'.
        - Views take the data stored in a model and display it to the student.
        - Controllers take requests from the user and perform alterations to the model.

        Before I show you my code, I need to make some basic explanations about some of the non-obvious rules and syntax
        of the ruby programming language:

        - Sections starting with `do` and finishing with `end` or using curly braces are blocks. They specify their
          arguments like functions but use the syntax `|arg1, arg2|`
          <pre><code class="nohighlight">[ "one", "two" ].each do |element|
              puts element # Puts is ruby's "print" statement
          end
          </code></pre>
          This would produce the output
          <pre><code class="nohighlight">one
          two
          </code></pre>
        - Functions can have the parenteses around the arguments left off where
          <pre><code class="nohighlight">function(arg1, arg2)</code></pre>
          is the same as
          <pre><code class="nohighlight">function arg1, arg2</code></pre>
        - The last line of a function is the return value.
          <pre><code class="nohighlight">def name
              return firstname + " " + lastname
            end
          </code></pre>
          is the same as
          <pre><code class="nohighlight">def name
              firstname + " " + lastname
          end
          </code></pre>

        I also want to note that tasks 1 and 2 were implemented at the same time so the code is for **both** tasks.

            This model isn't saved in the database therefore it's a simple class instead of the next two models, which
            extend `Sequel::Model`.

            This is a special method that processes creating a new object, you create new Questions using `Question.new`
            which calls the `initialise` method. I wanted to be able to initialise a question using a random value using
            `Question.new(min: 1, max: 10, operators: ["*", "-", "+"])` or using an existing value with
            `Question.new(1, "+", 2)`. In the first case arg1 would be a hash of options. It then calls `init_rand` with
            these options. If arg1 isn't a hash we use `init_pre` to try and initialise it using the given values.

            This method initialises the question from the given options. First it merges the given options with the
            defaults, then it uses the `rand_from_options` method twice to select a random number for the left and right
            sides using the minimum and maximums specified in the options. It then takes a random sample from the
            available operators. After that it uses to `do_sum` method to generate the answer from the left side,
            operator and right side.

            It first uses a case statement to decide what to do depending on if one of the operators is in the string
            given. It then splits the string into what is on either side of the operator, and assigns it to `val`. It
            also sets the `op` variable to the symbol of the operator. It then calls the constructor using the left side
            of the split, the operator and the right side of the split.

            This method is for retrieving the list of questions in this quiz. It overrides a default `question` method
            which would just return the raw data.

             The data is stored as a JSON hash with a key from 0 to 9 identifying the question, and a string in the
             format `8+5` which is the question.

            `@questions` is used as a cache variable so that it only has to query the database once per call. `super` is
            a special method which calls the default questions method to get the raw data in JSON format. It then checks
            if the raw data is empty, before using the JSON library to decode the data into a ruby hash of number to
            string. It then iterates through the array converting the strings to the `Question` object we saw
            previously. It then sets the `@question` variable so the decoding will be skipped and the cached value will
            be returned.

            This method returns a map of questions to answers. It checks to see if either the questions or answers are
            present first, then creates an array of arrays using the `map` function. The `map` function is like `each`
            but it creates a list using the return values of the block. Since the block used in the `map` function
            returns a list with two elements, you end up with a list of lists, which can be used to construct a Hash.
            For example the array of arrays`[["key1", "value1"], ["key2", "value2]]` would be converted to the hash
            `{ "key1" => "value1", "key2" => "value2" }`

            First, it checks to see if the `firstname`, `lastname` or `class` parameters from the form submission are
            blank. If they are then it returns a `HTTP 400 Bad Request` error with an explanation. It also fails if the
            class name is `all` because that name is used later on to represent a view of all classes.

            Next, it uses the `Student.find_or_create` method to find a student with the given first name, last name
            and class, or create one of a matching student does not exist. It then creates a quiz with the student found
            and a list of 10 questions from the `Question.get()` method I explained before.

            Finally, it redirects the client to the show method with the given quiz id. This is so that it doesn't
            generate a new quiz every time a student refreshes their page.
