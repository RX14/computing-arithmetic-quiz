<h2>Task 1</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students.
The program should generate a quiz consisting of a series of random questions, using in each case any two
numbers and addition, subtraction and multiplication. The system should ask the student&#39;s name, then ask 10
questions, output if the answer to each question is correct or not and produce a final score out of 10.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Success Criteria:</h3>

<ul>
<li>It must be able to generate a quiz containing 10 questions. In order to properly test the students in
consecutive quizzes, the program should generate random questions instead of using a reset 10 questions every
time.</li>
<li>The system must be able to ask the students name.</li>
<li>It must then show these questions to the student in a human-readable format so that the students can
understand what the program is asking them to solve.</li>
<li>The student should be able to enter an answer to the question.</li>
<li>The program should store the answers given so that a score can be given at the end of the quiz.</li>
</ul>

<p>After I have written the code I will test that the program performs as expected against these success criteria.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>I have made a flow chart to show the high level structure of the program I will be writing.
<img src="flowchart1.png" height="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>

<p>Alternately, I could have made the program ask a question then ask an answer, but I believe this solution to be
better suited to the medium which I have chosen to deliver this program on: the web.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>I have chosen to write this program as a web application instead of a commandline application for several
reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is easier for the students to access the program.</li>
<li>It is possible for multiple students to use the program at the same time.</li>
<li>I want to challenge myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Web pages are served in a language called HTML which describes the content of the page and how to display it.
HTML however is not a programming language because while it does provide a way of collecting user input, it
does not provide any way of using logic. Because of this limitation, I will have to write a program which
generates HTML and receives the user input from HTML.</p>

<p>I have chosen to write the program which generated the HTML in a programming language called ruby because I am
familiar with the language from previous projects and it has many tools already available for helping generate
and server webpages.</p>

<p>In particular I will be using a web framework called &quot;padrino&quot; to help me write the web application. The padrino
framework allows me to write in terms of models, views and controllers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Models represent the core data format of an application, in our case &#39;quiz&#39; and &#39;student&#39;.</li>
<li>Views take the data stored in a model and display it to the student.</li>
<li>Models take requests from the user and perform alterations to the model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before I show you my code, I need to make some basic explanations about some of the non-obvious rules and syntax
of the ruby programming language:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sections starting with <code>do</code> and finishing with <code>end</code> or using curly braces are blocks. They specify their
arguments like functions but use the syntax <code>|arg1, arg2|</code>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">[ &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot; ].each do |element|
  puts element # Puts is ruby&#39;s &quot;print&quot; statement
end
</code></pre>
This would produce the output
<pre><code class="nohighlight">one
two
</code></pre></li>
<li>Functions can have the parenteses around the arguments left off where
<pre><code class="nohighlight">function(arg1, arg2)</code></pre>
is the same as
<pre><code class="nohighlight">function arg1, arg2</code></pre></li>
<li>The last line of a function is the return value.
<pre><code class="nohighlight">def name
  return firstname + &quot; &quot; + lastname
end
</code></pre>
is the same as
<pre><code class="nohighlight">def name
  firstname + &quot; &quot; + lastname
end
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>I also want to note that tasks 1 and 2 were implemented at the same time so the code is for <strong>both</strong> tasks.</p>

 format <code>8+5</code> which is the question.</p>

<p><code>@questions</code> is used as a cache variable so that it only has to query the database once per call. <code>super</code> is
a special method which calls the default questions method to get the raw data in JSON format. It then checks
if the raw data is empty, before using the JSON library to decode the data into a ruby hash of number to
string. It then iterates through the array converting the strings to <code>Question</code> objects. It then sets the
<code>@question</code> variable so the decoding will be skipped and the cached value will be returned.</p>
